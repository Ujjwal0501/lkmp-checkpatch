NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 829b37b8cddb ("ext4: avoid race conditions when remounting with options that change dax") has style problems, please review.

      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
