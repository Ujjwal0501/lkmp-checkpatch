#7: 
With CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP enabled we can see the following with RTC probe:

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 10 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit afe6f1eeb08f ("bus: ti-sysc: Fix sleeping function called from invalid context for RTC quirk") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
