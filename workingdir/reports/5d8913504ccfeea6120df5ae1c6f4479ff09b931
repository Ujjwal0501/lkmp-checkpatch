#8: 
missed GPIO resource release. We can safely do this in the same quirk, since

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 13 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 5d8913504ccf ("gpio: pca953x: Fix GPIO resource leak on Intel Galileo Gen 2") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
