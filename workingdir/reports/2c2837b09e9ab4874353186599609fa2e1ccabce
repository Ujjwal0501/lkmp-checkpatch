NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 2c2837b09e9a ("selftests/bpf: Test bpf_link's get_next_id, get_fd_by_id, and get_obj_info") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
