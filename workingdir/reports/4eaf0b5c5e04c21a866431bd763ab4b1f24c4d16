total: 9 errors, 10 warnings, 285 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 4eaf0b5c5e04 ("selftest/bpf: Fmod_ret prog and implement test_overhead as part of bench") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
