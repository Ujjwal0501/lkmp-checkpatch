#13: 
introduced a new build warning on 64-bit allnoconfig kernels, that have CONFIG_VMAP_STACK disabled:

total: 1 errors, 1 warnings, 8 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 7102cb071326 ("x86/entry: Fix allnoconfig build warning") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
