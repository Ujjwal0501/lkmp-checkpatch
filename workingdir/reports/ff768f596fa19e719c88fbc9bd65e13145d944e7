      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit ff768f596fa1 ("media: docs: kAPI docs: move them to driver-api") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
