      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 85f78cec8494 ("Revert "dmaengine: dmatest: timeout value of -1 should specify infinite wait"") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
