#6: 
Bit 8 would be the "global" bit, which does not quite make sense for non-leaf

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 8 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 5ecad245de2a ("KVM: x86: bit 8 of non-leaf PDPEs is not reserved") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
