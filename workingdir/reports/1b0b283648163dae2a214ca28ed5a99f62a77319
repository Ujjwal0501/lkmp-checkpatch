#10: 
We check for concurrent setup only at the very end of the blktrace setup though.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'one'
#14: 
one tries to kill the first one one will see things like this:

total: 0 errors, 2 warnings, 25 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 1b0b28364816 ("blktrace: break out of blktrace setup on concurrent calls") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
