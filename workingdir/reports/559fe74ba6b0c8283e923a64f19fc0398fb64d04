#6: 
Anup originally re-spun his patch set to include this fix, but it was a bit too

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 8 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 559fe74ba6b0 ("irqchip/riscv-intc: Fix a typo in a pr_warn()") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
