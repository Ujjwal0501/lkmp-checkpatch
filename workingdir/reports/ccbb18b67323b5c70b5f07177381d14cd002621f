NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit ccbb18b67323 ("exec/binfmt_script: Don't modify bprm->buf and then return -ENOEXEC") has style problems, please review.

      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
