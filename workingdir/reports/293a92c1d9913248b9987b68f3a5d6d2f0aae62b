#7: 
This patch fixes a small typo I accidently submitted with the initial patch. The board should be named GA401 not G401.

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 24 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 293a92c1d991 ("ALSA: hda/realtek: typo_fix: enable headset mic of ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14(GA401) series with ALC289") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
