#8: 
in net/checksum.h is pointless here.  Just rename it and be done with that...

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 33 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 808b49da54e6 ("alpha: turn csum_partial_copy_from_user() into csum_and_copy_from_user()") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
