NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 3b536651eeb7 ("perf test: Provide a subtest callback to ask for the reason for skipping a subtest") has style problems, please review.

      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
