#7: 
During IPsec performance testing, we see bad ICMP checksum. The error packet

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 0 checks, 23 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 94579ac3f6d0 ("xfrm: Fix double ESP trailer insertion in IPsec crypto offload.") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
