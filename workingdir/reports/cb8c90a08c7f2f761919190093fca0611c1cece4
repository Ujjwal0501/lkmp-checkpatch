NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit cb8c90a08c7f ("efi/libstub: Rename efi_[char16_]printk to efi_[char16_]puts") has style problems, please review.

      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
