NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit 82af599b7036 ("readdir.c: get compat_filldir() more or less in sync with filldir()") has style problems, please review.

      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
