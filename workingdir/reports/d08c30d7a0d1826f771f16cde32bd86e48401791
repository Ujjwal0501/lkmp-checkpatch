ERROR:GIT_COMMIT_ID: Please use git commit description style 'commit <12+ chars of sha1> ("<title line>")' - ie: 'commit ec411e02b7a2 ("PCI/PM: Assume ports without DLL Link Active train links in 100 ms")'
#19: 
In both cases, reverting ec411e02b7a2 solved the problem.  Unfortunately,

total: 1 errors, 1 warnings, 52 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit d08c30d7a0d1 ("Revert "PCI/PM: Assume ports without DLL Link Active train links in 100 ms"") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
