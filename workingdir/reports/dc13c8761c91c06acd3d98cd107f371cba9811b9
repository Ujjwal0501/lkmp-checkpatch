NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

Commit dc13c8761c91 ("ipv4,appletalk: move SIOCADDRT and SIOCDELRT handling into ->compat_ioctl") has style problems, please review.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
